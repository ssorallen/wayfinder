    @component
    Draws the routes a rider can actually board from the selected stop, plus the
    live vehicles feeding those arrivals.

    Deliberately narrower than RouteMap, which draws a single trip's shape and
    clears the map first. This layer draws one shape per *route* in the arrivals
    list and owns its own teardown, so a stop selection and a trip expansion can
    coexist.

    @prop {Object} mapProvider
    @prop {ActiveRoute[]} activeRoutes - soonest arrival first; drives draw order
    @prop {Map<string, RouteColors>} routeColors
    @prop {string|null} promotedRouteId - the expanded arrival's route, drawn on top
    @prop {string|null} highlightedTripId - the expanded arrival's trip; its vehicle glows
    @prop {Map<string,string>} routeStopIds - bindable out: stop id -> ring-dot color
    @prop {Map<string,number>} liveCounts - bindable out: route id -> live vehicle count
